# FlashWeatherApp

A nice small web application to display the weather forecast for the current day from any town around the world.
Through an input field it is possible to write the name of the city we are looking for and search for it.
Underneath it will display a main card with the name and data from the searched city plus four small cards below it with data from four fixed cities: 
Rome, London, Madrid, New York.
The cards shows an icone to see immedially if the wheather will be sunny or cloudy and below the current temperature together with the minimum and the maximun of the day.
